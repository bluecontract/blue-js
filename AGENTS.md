### Agent Guidelines

**Purpose**: Ensure every contribution is type-safe and lint-clean.

- **TypeScript**: All code must pass TypeScript type checking without errors.
- **ESLint**: All code must pass ESLint with no lint errors.

Before marking a task as complete, run your TypeScript type-check and ESLint linting locally and fix any reported issues.

Example commands (adjust to your workspace):

- `tsc` (or your workspace type-check command)
- `eslint .` (or your workspace lint command)
